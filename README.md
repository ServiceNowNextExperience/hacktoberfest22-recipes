# Recipes

Let's enhance a simple, two-page recipe portal that lets you search and view recipes. What if you could rate or comment on the recipe, send a survey, track variations, etc. Also, if you make a change, go ahead and add a new recipe to the app for everyone. Additionally, if you want to know how to build this experience from scratch, check out [CCL1072](https://nowlearning.servicenow.com/lxp?id=learning_course_prev&course_id=000ebf3edb7e0990421266f748961990).
